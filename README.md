# DevOps Project

This repository is part of my DevOps learning path. It contains infrastructure and application code structured for a complete DevOps pipeline.

## Directory Structure
- **infra/**: Contains Terraform configurations for provisioning infrastructure.
- **app/**: Contains Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for deploying applications.

## Terraform Configuration
The `infra` directory includes a simple Terraform configuration to create an S3 bucket in AWS.

## Kubernetes Manifests
The `app` directory includes a sample Kubernetes deployment manifest for an Nginx application.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the respective directories to explore the configurations.
